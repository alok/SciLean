Note: Float.inf is now provided by Batteries.Lean.Float.
This file provides additional utilities if needed.

-- Re-export Float.inf from Batteries (for backwards compatibility)
-- Users should prefer Batteries.Lean.Float directly

-- If negInf is not in Batteries, define it here
-- Otherwise this can be removed entirely
